#1. What are average, max, and min values in the data?
#2. What about those numbers per category in the data (using HAVING)?
#3. What ways are there to group the data values that donâ€™t exist yet (using CASE)?
#4. What interesting ways are there to filter the data (using AND/OR)?

#1.
SELECT * FROM winstons_donut_logs;
SELECT AVG(donuts_eaten) FROM winstons_donut_logs;
SELECT * FROM winstons_donut_logs ORDER BY donuts_eaten;

#2.
SELECT status, AVG(donuts_eaten) AS total_donuts_eaten

#3.
