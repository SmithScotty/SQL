OVER designates the function as a window function.
PARTITION BY is a clause you can use in a window function. It divides the results into partitions, 
and performs the window function on each set of partitioned data.


Bike lanes with an average safety rating of 4 or more should be labeled "Leave As-Is".
Bike lanes with an average safety rating of less than 2.5 should be labeled as "Remove".
All other bike lanes should be labeled as "Improvements Needed".

SELECT street, safetyrating,
AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) as "Average_safety_rating",
CASE WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY safetyrating) >=4 THEN "Leave As-Is"
    WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY safetyrating) <2.5 THEN "Remove"
    ELSE "Improvements Needed"
    END AS "Recommendation"
