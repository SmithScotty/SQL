#1. Select all the movies.

#2. Now, add a second query after the first, that retrieves only the movies that were released in the year 2000 or later, not before.
Sort the results so that the earlier movies are listed first. 

 
#1. SELECT * FROM movies;
 
#2. SELECT * FROM movies
    WHERE release_year >2000 
    ORDER BY release_year;
