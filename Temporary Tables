Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
 
 SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity, 'Top Star' as label  
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING AVG(popularity) >= 90 

Using a CTE.

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)

SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity, 'Top Star' as label  
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
