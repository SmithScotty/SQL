What columns are in the customers table?

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers LIMIT 20;

What columns are in the JanSales table?

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales LIMIT 20;

Dealing with "messy data"
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers WHERE order_id <> ''
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

WHERE order_id <> ''
AND order_id <> 'Order ID'

<> means "does not equal"

'' means a blank cell
